Take the number that you've been given the factorial of.
Divide by 5; if you get a decimal, truncate to a whole number.
Divide by 5^2 = 25; if you get a decimal, truncate to a whole number.
Divide by 5^3 = 125; if you get a decimal, truncate to a whole number.
Continue with ever-higher powers of 5, until your division results in a number less than 1. Once the division is less than 1, stop.
Sum all the whole numbers you got in your divisions. This is the number of trailing zeroes.

sum = 0, i = 5;
while(n / i != 0)	sum += (n / i), i *= 5;
printf("%lld\n", sum);
